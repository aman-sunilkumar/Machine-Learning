# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** project repository â€” a curated collection of real-world applied ML projects focused on solving business-critical problems using structured data, feature engineering, and interpretable models.

Each project in this repository demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning solution â€” from data cleaning and EDA to model deployment and evaluation â€” tailored to practical use cases in marketing, credit risk, telecom, and more.
